  This demo is based on the BearPi-IoT_GD32F303 board, it shows how to use the key control
the LED and how to retarget the C library printf function to the USART. If the F1
key is detected pressed, LED will be turned on, and the EVAL_COM0 will print "USART 
printf example", otherwise LED will be turned off.
