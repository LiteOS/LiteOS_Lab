 Implementation Improvements
 ---------------------------
 
  - Store lwm2m_transaction_t per peer
  
  - bufferize all CoaP messages until all callbacks returned
  Currently if a server sends a request from its monitoring callback upon client
  registration, the client will receive the request before the ACK to its register
  and it will discard it.
  
  - Easy access to the lwm2m_context_t from objects callbacks
  
  - Use an unified result callback
  Add some parameter so that the same user callback can be used for all DM operations.
   
  - Use lwm2m-*-t types in er-coap-13
  To avoid multiple conversions.
  
  - Switch to void* parameters in lwm2m_list_* APIs
  
  - Utility functions to easily implements objects
  The utility will just use read and write individual resources. Either statically or
  through callbacks. See [https://github.com/01org/libdmclient]/tests/mgtobj/utils/static_mo_util.h
