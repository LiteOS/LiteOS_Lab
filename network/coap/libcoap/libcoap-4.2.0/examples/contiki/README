Example of libcoap running on contiki
=====================================

To run the example, do

    $ make
    $ sudo ./server.minimal-net

(and in a second terminal)

    $ sudo ip -6 a a aaaa::1/64 dev tap0

and query `coap://[aaaa::1000]/` with any coap tool.

This will

* download contike from the upstream git sources
* build the server application
* run the server application, creating a virtual network device tap0 (unless
  that exists)
* configure your network interface to make the server accessible.
